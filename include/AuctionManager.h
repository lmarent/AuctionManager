  the AuctionManager class allows to add and remove auctions in the Auction
  core system. Auction data are a set of ascii strings that are parsed
  and syntax checked by the AuctionManager and then their respective
  settings are used to configure the other AuctionCore components. 
  The Auction will then be stored in the AuctionDatabase inside the AuctionManager
